# Reinforcement Learning and Emergence of Language Playground
This personal repository hosts files created for my small exploratory experiments with Facebook's [Emergence of lanGuage in Games (EGG)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG, "EGG github repo") package, with the intent to introduce myself to deep reinforcement learning, information theory, and game theory.
